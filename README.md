# Fatal_Traffic-_Accidents
This shiny application uses the leaflet library to create an map of the U.S. states which is colored based on
the number of fatal traffic accidents per 100,000 people. The app allows the user to select the type of weather that was occuring during the time of the fatal accident. It also allows the user to select different color palettes. 

The traffic accident data obtained from: https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars
The population data and shape file data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau
Code for creating leaflet map was extrapolated from: https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/data-scientist-as-cartographer-an-introduction-to-making-interactive-maps-in-r-with-leaflet
